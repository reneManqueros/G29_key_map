# G29_key_map

A simple way to map the G29's D-Pad to the arrow keys.

## Installation
1) install python from the microsoft store: `https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pnrbtzxmb4z?hl=en-US&gl=US`
2) open up a terminal and install dependencies: `pip install pynput pygame`
3) Download the `control.py` file somewhere on your computer

## Usage
1) On a command prompt, go to the folder where the `control.py` file lives and run `python3 control.py`
2) There should be a small delay then a message saying `G29 detected as joystick#1`, the last number could change if you have multiple devices
3) you should be able to use the D-Pad in-game

## Notes
1) no support is given for this
2) if people like it, i could extend it to other devices OR to have a way to map custom keys
